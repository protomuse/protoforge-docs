description: "Step-by-step guide to creating and sending your first sync licensing contract using the ProtoForge dashboard"
---

This guide walks you through the end-to-end process of creating a sync licensing contract and sending it for signature — all from the ProtoForge dashboard. No code required.

<Callout type="info">
  This walkthrough uses the dashboard UI. For API integration, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) tab.
</Callout>

## The full flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your dashboard">
    Sign in to your ProtoForge account at your organization's dashboard URL. If this is your first time, your organization admin will have sent you an invitation email with a link to set up your credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Register a work">
    Navigate to **Works** in the sidebar and click **New Work**. The Work Registration Wizard opens with these steps:

    - **Basic Info** — Enter the track title, ISRC code (if available), genre, duration, and work type
    - **Contributors** — Add the composer(s), writer(s), and performer(s) with their roles and IPI numbers
    - **Territories** — Select the geographic regions where this work is available for licensing

    Click **Save** when you're done. You can always edit the work later.

    <Callout type="tip">
      Don't have an ISRC code yet? You can leave it blank for now and add it later. See [Registering a Work](/publishers/registering-works) for details.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add parties">
    Navigate to **Parties** in the sidebar and click **Add Party**. Create records for each person or organization involved in the deal:

    - The **licensor** (the rights holder granting the license — often you, the publisher)
    - The **licensee** (the person or company licensing the music for their project)
    - Any **co-publishers** or additional rights holders

    For each party, enter their name, email address, role, and (for rights holders) their IPI number and collection society.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a contract">
    Navigate to **Contracts** in the sidebar and click **New Contract**. This launches the 6-step contract wizard:

    1. **Select Work** — Choose the work you just registered
    2. **Select Parties** — Choose the licensor, licensee, and any additional parties
    3. **Choose Clauses** — Browse by category and select the clauses that apply to this deal
    4. **Fill Tokens** — Complete the data fields: effective date, fee amounts, territory scope, duration, and other deal terms
    5. **Preview** — Review the fully assembled contract
    6. **Generate** — Create the final contract document

    For a detailed walkthrough of each step, see [Creating a Contract](/publishers/creating-contracts).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select clauses">
    In step 3 of the wizard, you'll browse the clause library organized by category:

    - **Grant of Rights** — What rights are being licensed (sync, master use, etc.)
    - **Financial Terms** — Fee structure, payment schedules, advances, royalties
    - **Usage Restrictions** — Where and how the music can be used
    - **Termination** — Conditions for ending the agreement
    - **Representations & Warranties** — Legal assurances from each party

    Select the clauses that match your deal. ProtoForge flags any conflicts between your selected clauses automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and send for signature">
    After generating the contract, review the final document on the preview screen. Verify that:

    - All parties are listed correctly
    - The clause selections match the deal terms you agreed on
    - All token fields (dates, amounts, territories) are filled in accurately

    When everything looks right, click **Send for Signature**. Each party receives an email with a unique link to review and sign the contract electronically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once you send the contract:

- Each signer receives an email with a secure signing link
- You can track signature progress on the **Contracts** page — see who has signed and who is pending
- When all parties have signed, the contract is marked as **Fully Executed** and everyone receives a PDF copy
- Every action is logged in the [Audit Trail](/publishers/audit-trail) for compliance
