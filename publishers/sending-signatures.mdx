After generating a contract, you can send it to all parties for electronic signature directly from the ProtoForge dashboard. Signatures are handled through DocuSeal, a secure e-signature platform integrated into ProtoForge.

## Sending a contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the generated contract">
    From the **Contracts** page, click on the contract you want to send. You'll see the contract detail page with the generated PDF and a summary of parties, clauses, and terms.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Send for Signature">
    Click the **Send for Signature** button. ProtoForge displays a confirmation dialog showing each party who will receive a signing request, along with their email address and role in the contract.

    Verify that the signer list is correct. Each party listed will receive an individual email with a unique signing link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm and send">
    Click **Confirm** to dispatch the signing requests. ProtoForge routes the contract to DocuSeal, which sends an email to each party with their personalized signing link.

    The contract status changes to **Pending Signatures** on the dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracking signature status

Once a contract is sent, the **Contracts** page shows its current status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Contract has been generated but not yet sent for signature |
| **Pending Signatures** | Sent to signers; waiting for one or more parties to sign |
| **Partially Signed** | At least one party has signed, but others are still pending |
| **Fully Executed** | All parties have signed; the contract is complete |
| **Expired** | The signing link has expired (links are valid for 7 days) |

On the contract detail page, you can see which specific parties have signed and which are still pending, along with timestamps for each signing event.

## The signing experience

From the signer's perspective, the process is straightforward:

1. They receive an email from ProtoForge with a link to review the contract
2. They click the link and open the contract in their browser — no account or software required
3. They review the full contract, including all clauses and terms
4. They sign electronically by drawing or typing their signature
5. They receive a confirmation that their signature has been recorded

<Callout type="info">
  Signers do not need a ProtoForge account. The signing experience is designed for people who may be encountering ProtoForge for the first time. For a detailed guide from the signer's perspective, see [For Composers: Signing](/composers/signing).
</Callout>

## Completion

When the last party signs:

- The contract status updates to **Fully Executed**
- All parties receive an email with a PDF copy of the fully executed contract
- The signing events are recorded in the [Audit Trail](/publishers/audit-trail) with timestamps and hash-chain verification
- The executed PDF is stored in ProtoForge and available for download from the contract detail page

## Resending and reminders

If a signer hasn't responded, you can:

- **Resend the signing email** from the contract detail page by clicking **Resend** next to the pending signer's name
- View when the original email was sent and whether it was opened

<Callout type="warning">
  Signing links expire after 7 days for security. If a link expires, you can resend a new link from the contract detail page. The original contract is not affected.
</Callout>

## Automated workflows

For teams that need to integrate the signing flow into their own systems, ProtoForge provides webhook events that fire when signature events occur. Common events include:

- `contract.generated` — A contract was generated and sent for signature
- `contract.signed` — A party signed the contract
- `payment.confirmed` — Payment has been confirmed for the contract

<Callout type="info">
  Webhook configuration and event payloads are covered in the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction). No API knowledge is needed to use the dashboard signing flow described on this page.
