The ProtoForge dashboard is your central workspace for managing musical works, assembling sync licensing contracts, and tracking every action through a tamper-proof audit trail. This page introduces each section of the dashboard so you know where to find what you need.

## Dashboard sections

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Works" icon="music" href="/publishers/registering-works">
    Register and manage your musical works. Each work includes metadata (ISRC, ISWC, genre, duration), contributors with roles and IPI numbers, and the territories where the work is available for licensing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contracts" icon="file-contract" href="/publishers/creating-contracts">
    Create, edit, and track sync licensing contracts. The 6-step contract wizard walks you through clause selection, token assignment, and deterministic contract assembly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parties" icon="users" href="/publishers/quickstart">
    Manage the people and organizations involved in your deals — composers, co-publishers, performers, licensees, and other rights holders. Each party record stores contact details, IPI numbers, and collection society affiliations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clauses" icon="scale-balanced" href="/concepts/contract-templates">
    Browse the library of 146 pre-approved legal clauses organized by category: Grant of Rights, Financial Terms, Usage Restrictions, Representations and Warranties, Termination, and more. Every contract is assembled from this vetted library — no ad-hoc legal text.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Trail" icon="shield-check" href="/publishers/audit-trail">
    View tamper-proof logs of every contract action. Each entry is cryptographically linked to the previous via hash-chain verification, so the full history is verifiable and cannot be altered after the fact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings" icon="gear" href="/publishers/audit-trail">
    Configure your organization: team members and roles, notification preferences, API keys for developer integrations, and general account settings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How the sections connect

A typical workflow moves through these sections in order:

1. **Register works** in the Works section with full metadata and contributor information
2. **Add parties** so the platform knows who is involved in the deal
3. **Create a contract** using the wizard, which pulls in the work, parties, and clauses you select
4. **Send for signature** to route the contract to all parties via DocuSeal
5. **Track progress** on the dashboard and in the Audit Trail as signatures come in

Each step feeds into the next. Works and parties are reusable across multiple contracts, so you only need to enter them once.

## Navigation

The main sidebar provides direct access to each section. From any page you can:

- Use the sidebar to switch between Works, Contracts, Parties, Clauses, Audit Trail, and Settings
- Use the search bar at the top of the dashboard to find specific works, contracts, or parties by name or identifier
- Click on any entity (work, contract, party) to view its full detail page, including entity-level audit history
