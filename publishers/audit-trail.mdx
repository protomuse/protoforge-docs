Every action in ProtoForge — from creating a work to signing a contract — is recorded in a tamper-proof audit trail. This trail provides a complete, verifiable history of every event, satisfying legal requirements for contract audit and regulatory compliance.

## What gets logged

The audit trail captures every meaningful event across the platform:

| Entity | Logged actions |
|--------|---------------|
| **Contracts** | Created, clauses selected, clauses changed, tokens filled, generated, sent for signature, signed by each party, fully executed, edited, new version created |
| **Works** | Registered, metadata updated, contributors added or removed, splits changed, territories modified |
| **Parties** | Created, details updated, associated with a contract, removed from a contract |
| **Signatures** | Signing link sent, link opened, signature submitted, contract completed |
| **PDF generation** | PDF generated, PDF downloaded, PDF shared |
| **System events** | Bulk imports processed, webhook events received, API access |

Each log entry includes:

- **Timestamp** — Exact date and time (UTC) of the action
- **Actor** — Who performed the action (user name and ID)
- **Action type** — What was done (created, updated, signed, etc.)
- **Entity** — The specific contract, work, or party affected
- **Details** — A summary of what changed (e.g., "Clause GRANT_SYNC_001_V1 added")
- **Hash** — Cryptographic hash linking this entry to the previous one

## Hash-chain integrity

<Callout type="info">
  ProtoForge's audit trail uses hash-chain verification — each entry is cryptographically linked to the previous entry, making tampering detectable. If any entry were altered or deleted, the chain would break and the inconsistency would be immediately visible.
</Callout>

The hash-chain works as follows:

1. Each audit log entry is assigned a cryptographic hash based on its contents (timestamp, actor, action, details)
2. That hash also incorporates the hash of the previous entry, creating a chain
3. To verify the trail, ProtoForge recalculates the chain from the first entry forward — if any link doesn't match, the trail has been tampered with
4. The chain is verified automatically; you can also trigger a manual verification from the Audit Trail page

This approach mirrors the integrity model described in ProtoForge's Constitution (Article VIII), ensuring that the audit record is trustworthy for legal and regulatory purposes.

## Viewing the audit trail

Navigate to **Audit Trail** in the sidebar to access the full log. The audit trail page provides several ways to find what you need:

### Filters

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Entity type** | Contract, Work, Party, or All |
| **Date range** | Start date and end date |
| **Action type** | Created, Updated, Signed, Generated, Sent, and others |
| **Actor** | Filter by a specific team member |

### Entity-level audit

From any contract, work, or party detail page, click the **History** tab to see the complete audit trail for that specific entity. This is the fastest way to answer "what happened to this contract?" without searching the global log.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Contract history">
    A contract's history shows every event from creation through execution:

    - Contract created (with initial clause selections)
    - Each clause added or removed
    - Each token value filled or changed
    - Contract generated (PDF created)
    - Sent for signature (with signer list)
    - Each party's signature event
    - Fully executed (all signatures received)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Work history">
    A work's history tracks all metadata and rights changes:

    - Work registered (with initial metadata)
    - Title or identifier changes
    - Contributors added, removed, or modified
    - Split percentages changed
    - Territory selections updated
    - Contracts created from this work (with links)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Party history">
    A party's history shows their record changes and contract involvement:

    - Party created (with initial details)
    - Contact information updated
    - IPI number or collection society changed
    - Associated with a contract
    - Signed a contract (with timestamp and contract link)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Compliance

The audit trail is designed to meet legal and regulatory requirements for contract management:

- **Legal audit** — Every contract can be traced from creation through execution with a complete, tamper-proof record. This satisfies legal requirements for demonstrating that contracts were properly executed.
- **Internal compliance** — Organization admins can review who did what and when, supporting internal governance policies.
- **Dispute resolution** — If a question arises about a contract's terms or signing history, the audit trail provides a definitive record.
- **Data protection** — Audit log entries record actions but do not duplicate contract content. Access to the audit trail follows the same role-based permissions as the rest of the platform.

## Exporting audit logs

To export audit logs for external review or compliance reporting:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply filters">
    Use the date range, entity type, and action type filters to narrow the log to the relevant entries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export">
    Click the **Export** button in the top-right corner of the Audit Trail page. Choose your format: CSV or JSON.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the file">
    The export file includes all filtered entries with their timestamps, actors, actions, details, and hash values. This file can be provided to auditors, legal counsel, or regulatory bodies as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  For automated audit log retrieval, the API provides endpoints to query and export audit entries programmatically. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details.
