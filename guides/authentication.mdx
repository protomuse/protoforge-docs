# ProtoForge Authentication with API Keys

<Callout type="info" title="What This Guide Covers">
  How to authenticate with the ProtoForge API using Bearer tokens, understand test vs live keys, and configure org-scoped access.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- A ProtoForge account at [app.protoforge.com](https://app.protoforge.com)

<Snippet file="snippets/test-mode.mdx" />

## How Authentication Works

Every ProtoForge API request requires a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. API keys are org-scoped — all resources created with a key belong to that organisation.

<Steps>

### Get Your API Key

1. Log in to [app.protoforge.com](https://app.protoforge.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create Key** and choose test or live mode
4. Copy the key — it will only be shown once

### Set the Authorization Header

Include your API key as a Bearer token in every request:

<Snippet file="snippets/auth-header.mdx" />

### Make Your First Authenticated Request

Verify your key works by searching the track catalogue:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?genre=ambient", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});

if (response.status === 401) {
  console.error("Invalid API key — check your Authorization header");
} else {
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(`Found ${data.pagination.total} tracks`);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?genre=ambient" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\n"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search",
    params={"genre": "ambient"},
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)

if response.status_code == 401:
    print("Invalid API key — check your Authorization header")
else:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Found {data['pagination']['total']} tracks")
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trk_abc123",
      "title": "Ethereal Waves",
      "artist": "Ambient Works",
      "bpm": 72,
      "genre": "ambient",
      "status": "available"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "per_page": 20, "total": 1 }
}
```

</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### Org-Scoped Access

API keys are tied to a single organisation. When you create a license or register a webhook, that resource belongs to your organisation and is invisible to other organisations.

### Key Rotation

To rotate a key:

1. Create a new key in **Settings > API Keys**
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Revoke the old key once all traffic migrates

There is no downtime — both keys work simultaneously until you revoke the old one.

### Security Best Practices

- Never expose API keys in client-side code, Git repositories, or logs
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Use test keys (`pk_test_`) during development — they cannot create real licenses
- Rotate keys immediately if exposed

<Accordion title="Common Mistakes">

**Wrong header format**
```
# Wrong — missing "Bearer" prefix
Authorization: pk_test_your_api_key

# Correct
Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key
```

**Using live key in test environment**
Live keys (`pk_live_`) create real licenses and may trigger payments. Always use `pk_test_` keys during development.

**Key in query parameters**
API keys must be sent in the `Authorization` header, never as query parameters.
