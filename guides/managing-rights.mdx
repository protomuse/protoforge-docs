# Managing Rights Metadata and Splits

<Callout type="info" title="What This Guide Covers">
  How to work with rights metadata in track responses — ISRC codes, rights holder roles, percentage splits, and territory-specific availability.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Authenticated with the ProtoForge API ([Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication))
- Understand track search results ([Searching the Catalogue](/guides/searching-catalogue))

## Rights Metadata in Track Responses

Every track in ProtoForge carries complete rights metadata. When you retrieve a track, the response includes rights holders with their roles and revenue share percentages:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/trk_abc123", {
  headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" }
});

const track = await response.json();
console.log("Rights holders:", track.rights_holders);
console.log("Available territories:", track.available_territories);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/trk_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/trk_abc123",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key"}
)

track = response.json()
print("Rights holders:", track["rights_holders"])
print("Available territories:", track["available_territories"])
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "trk_abc123",
  "title": "Neon Pulse",
  "isrc": "GB-ABC-24-00001",
  "rights_holders": [
    { "name": "Alex Morgan", "role": "writer", "share_percentage": 50 },
    { "name": "Neon Music Publishing", "role": "publisher", "share_percentage": 30 },
    { "name": "Synthwave Collective", "role": "performer", "share_percentage": 20 }
  ],
  "available_territories": ["GB", "US", "DE", "FR"]
}
```

## The 100% Rule

<Callout type="warning" title="Rights Splits Must Sum to 100%">
  Every track's `rights_holders[].share_percentage` values must sum to exactly 100%. ProtoForge validates this automatically — tracks with incomplete splits have status `restricted` and cannot be licensed.
</Callout>

In the example above: 50% (writer) + 30% (publisher) + 20% (performer) = 100%.

### How Splits Work

| Role | Typical Share | What They Control |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| `writer` | 30-60% | Musical composition (melody, lyrics) |
| `publisher` | 20-50% | Publishing rights, licensing authority |
| `performer` | 10-30% | Master recording, performance rights |

Revenue from a sync license is distributed according to these percentages. ProtoForge calculates and reports the split for each party automatically.

## ISRC Codes

The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) uniquely identifies each recording. ProtoForge uses the format `CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN`:

| Component | Length | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| CC | 2 chars | Country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) | `GB` |
| XXX | 3 chars | Registrant code (alphanumeric) | `ABC` |
| YY | 2 digits | Year of registration | `24` |
| NNNNN | 5 digits | Designation code | `00001` |

ProtoForge validates ISRC format on every track. Invalid ISRCs prevent the track from being listed as `available`.

## Territory-Specific Rights

A track may be available in some territories but not others. The `available_territories` array lists all territories where the track can be licensed:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Search only for tracks available in both GB and US
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?territory=GB&territory=US",
  {
    headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" }
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
// All returned tracks are available in both GB and US
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?territory=GB&territory=US" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search",
    params=[("territory", "GB"), ("territory", "US")],
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key"}
)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trk_abc123",
      "title": "Neon Pulse",
      "available_territories": ["GB", "US", "DE", "FR"],
      "status": "available"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "per_page": 20, "total": 1 }
}
```

When creating a license, all requested territories must be in the track's `available_territories`. If a territory is missing, the API returns a `422 Validation Error`.

<Accordion title="Common Mistakes">

**Splits not summing to 100%**
If you encounter a track with status `restricted`, the most common cause is rights holder shares not summing to 100%. Contact the track owner to correct the metadata.

**Invalid ISRC format**
ISRC codes must follow `CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN` exactly. Common mistakes: missing hyphens, lowercase country codes, or wrong segment lengths.

**Confusing territory availability with licensing**
A track being "available" in a territory means the rights metadata supports licensing there — the track may still have an active exclusive license that prevents new licenses.
