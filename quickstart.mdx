# License a Track in 5 Minutes

This quickstart walks you through the complete ProtoForge licensing flow using test API keys. By the end, you will have searched the track catalogue, created a sync license, and verified webhook delivery.

<Snippet file="snippets/test-mode.mdx" />

<Steps>

### Get Your API Key

Sign up at [app.protoforge.com](https://app.protoforge.com) and navigate to **Settings > API Keys**. Copy your test key — it starts with `pk_test_`.

Your test key is org-scoped, meaning all resources you create are isolated to your organisation.

### Search the Track Catalogue

Use the search endpoint to find tracks matching your production needs. You can filter by BPM, key, genre, mood, and territory.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?genre=electronic&bpm_min=120&bpm_max=140&territory=GB",
  {
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search?genre=electronic&bpm_min=120&bpm_max=140&territory=GB" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/tracks/search",
    params={
        "genre": "electronic",
        "bpm_min": 120,
        "bpm_max": 140,
        "territory": "GB"
    },
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trk_abc123",
      "title": "Neon Pulse",
      "artist": "Synthwave Collective",
      "duration_seconds": 214,
      "bpm": 128,
      "key": "A minor",
      "genre": "electronic",
      "mood": ["energetic", "uplifting"],
      "isrc": "GB-ABC-24-00001",
      "rights_holders": [
        { "name": "Alex Morgan", "role": "writer", "share_percentage": 50 },
        { "name": "Neon Music Publishing", "role": "publisher", "share_percentage": 50 }
      ],
      "available_territories": ["GB", "US", "DE", "FR"],
      "status": "available"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

### Select a Track

From the search results, pick a track and note its `id`. You will use this to create the license.

In the example above, the track `trk_abc123` ("Neon Pulse") is available in GB with rights holders whose shares sum to exactly 100%.

<Callout type="info" title="Rights Validation">
  ProtoForge validates that rights holder shares sum to exactly 100% for every track. Tracks with incomplete rights metadata have status `restricted` and cannot be licensed.
</Callout>

### Create a License

Create a sync license by specifying the track, usage type, territory, and duration.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.protoforge.com/v1/licenses", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    track_id: "trk_abc123",
    usage_type: "film",
    territory: ["GB"],
    duration_months: 24,
    exclusive: false,
    notes: "Background music for independent short film"
  })
});

const license = await response.json();
console.log(license);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/licenses" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "track_id": "trk_abc123",
    "usage_type": "film",
    "territory": ["GB"],
    "duration_months": 24,
    "exclusive": false,
    "notes": "Background music for independent short film"
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/licenses",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "track_id": "trk_abc123",
        "usage_type": "film",
        "territory": ["GB"],
        "duration_months": 24,
        "exclusive": False,
        "notes": "Background music for independent short film"
    }
)

license = response.json()
print(license)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "lic_xyz789",
  "track_id": "trk_abc123",
  "organisation_id": "org_your_org",
  "usage_type": "film",
  "territory": ["GB"],
  "duration_months": 24,
  "exclusive": false,
  "status": "draft",
  "created_at": "2026-02-22T10:30:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2028-02-22T10:30:00Z",
  "contract_id": null
}
```

### Verify Webhook Delivery

ProtoForge sends webhook events when license state changes. To receive events, register a webhook endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.protoforge.com/v1/webhooks", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    url: "https://your-app.com/webhooks/protoforge",
    events: ["license.created", "license.approved", "contract.signed"]
  })
});

const webhook = await response.json();
console.log(webhook);
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_test_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/protoforge",
    "events": ["license.created", "license.approved", "contract.signed"]
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.protoforge.com/v1/webhooks",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer pk_test_your_api_key",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/protoforge",
        "events": ["license.created", "license.approved", "contract.signed"]
    }
)

webhook = response.json()
print(webhook)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "whk_def456",
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/protoforge",
  "events": ["license.created", "license.approved", "contract.signed"],
  "active": true,
  "created_at": "2026-02-22T10:31:00Z"
}
```

When the license you created in Step 4 is approved, ProtoForge sends a `license.approved` event to your webhook URL:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_ghi012",
  "type": "license.approved",
  "created_at": "2026-02-22T10:35:00Z",
  "data": {
    "license_id": "lic_xyz789",
    "approved_by": "admin@your-org.com"
  }
}
```

</Steps>

## What You Built

In 5 steps, you completed the entire ProtoForge licensing pipeline:

1. Authenticated with a test API key
2. Searched tracks by genre, BPM, and territory
3. Selected a track with validated rights metadata
4. Created a sync license with usage type and territory
5. Registered a webhook to monitor license events
