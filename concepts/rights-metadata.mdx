# Rights Metadata and Revenue Splits

Every piece of recorded music has a complex web of rights attached to it. ProtoForge tracks this metadata to ensure every sync license correctly identifies who gets paid and how much.

## What is Rights Metadata?

Rights metadata is the structured information that describes:

- **Who** owns rights to a recording (writers, publishers, performers)
- **What** rights each party controls (composition, master recording, performance)
- **How much** each party receives from licensing revenue (percentage splits)
- **Where** the track can be licensed (territory restrictions)

## Industry Standard Identifiers

The music industry uses standardised codes to uniquely identify works, recordings, and parties:

### ISRC — International Standard Recording Code

Every recording has a unique ISRC in the format `CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN`:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `CC` | Country of registration (ISO 3166-1) | `GB` |
| `XXX` | Registrant code (assigned by national agency) | `ABC` |
| `YY` | Year of registration | `24` |
| `NNNNN` | Designation code (unique per registrant per year) | `00001` |

**Example:** `GB-ABC-24-00001` identifies a specific recording registered in the UK in 2024.

### ISWC — International Standard Musical Work Code

The ISWC identifies the underlying musical composition (not the recording). Format: `T-DDD.DDD.DDD-C`

- A single composition (ISWC) can have multiple recordings (ISRCs)
- For example, a composition and its cover version share the same ISWC but have different ISRCs

### IPI — Interested Parties Information

IPI numbers identify individuals and organisations involved in music rights:

- **IPI Name Number** — 9-11 digits, identifies a person or entity
- **IPI Base Number** — links all name variations to a single party
- Used by collection societies (PRS, ASCAP, BMI, GEMA, SACEM) worldwide

## Rights Holders and Roles

Every track in ProtoForge lists its rights holders with three properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Legal name of the rights holder |
| `role` | `writer`, `publisher`, or `performer` |
| `share_percentage` | Percentage of licensing revenue allocated to this party |

### Understanding Roles

| Role | Controls | Typical Share |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Writer** | The musical composition — melody, harmony, lyrics | 30-60% |
| **Publisher** | Publishing rights — licensing authority, catalogue management | 20-50% |
| **Performer** | The master recording — the specific performance captured | 10-30% |

A single person can hold multiple roles (e.g., a singer-songwriter who is both writer and performer).

## The 100% Rule

<Callout type="warning" title="Splits Must Sum to Exactly 100%">
  Every track's rights holder shares must sum to exactly 100%. No more, no less. ProtoForge enforces this automatically — tracks with incomplete or over-allocated splits cannot be licensed.
</Callout>

### Why 100%?

If shares do not total 100%, revenue distribution is ambiguous:

- **Under 100%** — Unclaimed revenue has no designated recipient
- **Over 100%** — More money is owed than received, creating a deficit
- **Exactly 100%** — Every pound of licensing revenue is accounted for

### Example Splits

**Simple (two parties):**

| Rights Holder | Role | Share |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Sarah Chen | Writer | 60% |
| Horizon Publishing | Publisher | 40% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

**Complex (four parties):**

| Rights Holder | Role | Share |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Alex Morgan | Writer | 35% |
| Jamie Walsh | Writer | 15% |
| Neon Music Publishing | Publisher | 30% |
| Synthwave Collective | Performer | 20% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

## Territory Restrictions

Rights can be territory-specific. A publisher may control rights in the UK and Europe but not in the US or Asia. ProtoForge tracks this with the `available_territories` field:

- Each territory uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes (e.g., `GB`, `US`, `DE`, `JP`)
- A track can only be licensed in territories listed in `available_territories`
- Attempting to license in an unavailable territory returns a validation error

## How ProtoForge Validates Metadata

ProtoForge runs automated validation on every track:

| Check | Rule | Result if Invalid |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| ISRC format | Must match `CC-XXX-YY-NNNNN` pattern | Track marked `restricted` |
| Rights holder shares | Must sum to exactly 100% | Track marked `restricted` |
| Territory codes | Must be valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 | Territory rejected |
| IPI numbers | Must pass modulo-10 check digit | Warning flagged |

Tracks that fail validation receive status `restricted` and cannot be licensed until their metadata is corrected.
