# Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation

ProtoForge is a multi-tenant platform — multiple organisations use the same infrastructure while their data remains completely isolated. An organisation's tracks, licenses, contracts, and templates are invisible to every other organisation.

## How Data Isolation Works

### Org-Scoped API Keys

Every API key belongs to a single organisation. When you authenticate with an API key, all operations are scoped to that organisation:

- **Search** returns only tracks in your organisation's catalogue
- **Licenses** you create belong to your organisation
- **Templates** you create are visible only to your organisation
- **Webhooks** deliver events only for your organisation's resources

There is no way to access another organisation's data through the API, even with a valid API key.

### Organisation Boundaries

| Resource | Scoped To | Cross-Org Visible? |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tracks | Organisation catalogue | No |
| Licenses | Organisation | No |
| Contracts | Organisation | No |
| Templates | Organisation | No |
| Webhooks | Organisation | No |
| API Keys | Organisation | No |
| Audit Logs | Organisation | No |

### Key Separation

ProtoForge maintains separate API keys for each environment:

| Key Type | Prefix | Environment | Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Test | `pk_test_` | Sandbox | Sample tracks, no real licenses |
| Live | `pk_live_` | Production | Real catalogue, binding licenses |

Test and live environments are fully isolated — a test key cannot access live data and vice versa.

## Permissions and Access Control

Within an organisation, ProtoForge supports role-based access:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access — manage API keys, templates, team members |
| **Admin** | Create and manage licenses, contracts, and templates |
| **Member** | View resources, create licenses (cannot manage templates or keys) |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to all resources |

Roles are managed through the ProtoForge dashboard at [app.protoforge.com](https://app.protoforge.com).

## Audit Trails

Every action within an organisation is logged in a tamper-evident audit trail:

- **Who** performed the action (user ID)
- **What** was done (created, updated, approved, signed)
- **When** the action occurred (ISO 8601 timestamp)
- **Which** resources were affected (license ID, contract ID, etc.)

Audit logs are append-only and protected by a SHA-256 hash chain — each entry references the hash of the previous entry, making it impossible to alter historical records without detection.

### Retention

| Data Category | Retention Period |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Contract records | 7+ years |
| Audit logs | 7+ years |
| Session data | 30 days |

## Data Protection

ProtoForge follows GDPR principles for data handling:

- **Data minimisation** — only data necessary for licensing is collected
- **Right to access** — export your data via the API at any time
- **Right to erasure** — soft deletion with pseudonymisation (audit integrity preserved)
- **Cross-border transfers** — Standard Contractual Clauses for non-EEA transfers

<Callout type="info" title="Compliance">
  ProtoForge processes contract data under GDPR Article 6(1)(b) — contract performance. Audit logs are retained under Article 6(1)(c) — legal obligation. No data is used for marketing without explicit consent.
