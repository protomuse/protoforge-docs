# What is Sync Licensing

**Synchronisation licensing** (sync licensing) is the process of obtaining legal permission to use a piece of music alongside visual media — film, television, advertising, video games, and digital content.

When you hear a track in a film trailer, a TV commercial, or a video game cutscene, someone negotiated a sync license to make that happen.

## How Traditional Sync Licensing Works

The traditional sync licensing process involves multiple parties, manual negotiation, and significant time:

### 1. Discovery

A music supervisor searches for the right track. This often means browsing multiple music libraries, contacting publishers, and listening to hundreds of tracks across fragmented catalogues.

### 2. Rights Identification

Once a track is selected, the supervisor must identify every rights holder:

- **Writers** — Who wrote the composition (melody and lyrics)?
- **Publishers** — Who controls the publishing rights?
- **Performers** — Who performed on the master recording?

Each party may have a different share of the revenue, and shares must total exactly 100%.

### 3. Negotiation

The supervisor negotiates terms with each rights holder individually:

- **Usage type** — How will the music be used? (Film, TV, advertising, digital, gaming)
- **Territory** — Where will the content be distributed? (UK only, worldwide, specific regions)
- **Duration** — How long will the license last? (6 months, 2 years, perpetuity)
- **Exclusivity** — Can others license the same track for similar use?
- **Fee** — How much will each party be paid?

### 4. Contract Drafting

A legal team drafts the sync license agreement, incorporating the negotiated terms with appropriate legal clauses. Each clause must be reviewed for accuracy and compliance.

### 5. Signature Collection

All parties must sign the agreement — often via email, courier, or wet ink signatures across different time zones.

## The Problem

This process typically takes **2-6 weeks** per sync license. For productions with tight deadlines or multiple tracks, the delays can be costly:

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Fragmented catalogues | Hours spent searching across multiple platforms |
| Manual rights lookup | Days waiting for publisher responses |
| Individual negotiation | Weeks of back-and-forth with each party |
| Legal drafting | Expensive legal review for every agreement |
| Signature collection | Days waiting for all parties to sign |

## How ProtoForge Automates Sync Licensing

ProtoForge replaces each manual step with an API call:

| Traditional Step | ProtoForge Equivalent | Time |
|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Search catalogues | `GET /v1/tracks/search` — filter by BPM, genre, mood, territory | Seconds |
| Identify rights holders | Rights metadata included in every track response | Instant |
| Negotiate terms | `POST /v1/licenses` — specify usage, territory, duration | Seconds |
| Draft contract | `POST /v1/contracts` — deterministic assembly from pre-approved clauses | < 2 seconds |
| Collect signatures | Integrated e-signature workflow | Hours (not weeks) |

**Total time: Under 10 seconds** for search through contract generation (excluding signature collection, which depends on signers).

### Key Differentiators

- **Single catalogue** — All tracks searchable through one API with consistent metadata
- **Pre-validated rights** — Every track has verified rights holders with shares summing to 100%
- **Deterministic contracts** — Contracts assembled from 146 pre-approved legal clauses (no AI-generated legal text)
- **Real-time webhooks** — Instant notifications when licenses are approved, contracts signed, or payments confirmed
