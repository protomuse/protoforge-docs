# What is ProtoForge

ProtoForge is a sync licensing automation API that transforms the way music rights are licensed for film, TV, advertising, and digital content. What traditionally takes weeks of manual negotiation, ProtoForge completes in seconds through deterministic contract assembly.

## The Problem

Licensing music for visual media — known as **sync licensing** — involves:

1. **Finding the right track** across fragmented catalogues
2. **Identifying rights holders** (writers, publishers, performers)
3. **Negotiating terms** with each party individually
4. **Drafting contracts** with correct legal clauses
5. **Collecting signatures** from all parties

Each step involves manual effort, email chains, and legal review. A single sync license can take 2-6 weeks to complete.

## How ProtoForge Solves This

ProtoForge provides a REST API that automates the entire pipeline:

| Step | Traditional | ProtoForge |
|------|------------|------------|
| Search tracks | Browse multiple catalogues | Single API call with filters |
| Check rights | Manual rights holder lookup | Rights metadata in every track response |
| Create license | Draft and negotiate | `POST /v1/licenses` with validated terms |
| Generate contract | Manual legal drafting | Deterministic assembly from pre-approved clauses |
| Collect signatures | Email and courier | Integrated e-signature workflow |
