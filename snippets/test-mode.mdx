<Callout type="warning" title="Test Mode vs Live Mode">
  ProtoForge API keys are org-scoped and come in two variants:

  - **Test keys** (`pk_test_*`) — Use during development. Test keys access a sandbox environment with sample tracks and do not create real licenses or trigger payments.
  - **Live keys** (`pk_live_*`) — Use in production. Live keys access real track catalogues and create binding licenses.

  Get your API keys from the [ProtoForge Dashboard](https://app.protoforge.com/settings/api-keys). Never expose live keys in client-side code or version control.
