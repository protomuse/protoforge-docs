<Callout type="info" title="Rate Limits">
  ProtoForge enforces per-key rate limits by endpoint category:

  | Category | Limit | Header |
  |----------|-------|--------|
  | Track search | 100 requests/min | `X-RateLimit-Limit: 100` |
  | License creation | 30 requests/min | `X-RateLimit-Limit: 30` |
  | Contract generation | 20 requests/min | `X-RateLimit-Limit: 20` |
  | Bulk operations | 5 requests/min | `X-RateLimit-Limit: 5` |

  Rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) are included in every API response. When the limit is exceeded, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.
