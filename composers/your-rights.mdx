When you sign a sync licensing contract, you're granting specific rights to use your music in specific ways. This page explains what those rights are, how revenue splits work, and what protections are built into the process.

## Two kinds of rights

In sync licensing, there are two distinct sets of rights that may be involved. Your contract may cover one or both:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sync Rights" icon="film">
    These cover the **musical composition** — the melody, lyrics, and arrangement you wrote. Sync rights give permission to synchronize your composition with visual content like a film scene or TV commercial.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Master Rights" icon="record-vinyl">
    These cover the **sound recording** — the specific recorded version of the music. If someone wants to use your actual recording (not just a cover or re-record), they need master rights.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you wrote and recorded the music yourself, both rights may belong to you. If you wrote the song but someone else produced the recording, the sync rights might be yours while the master rights belong to the recording owner.

## How rights splits work

A rights split defines what percentage of the revenue each party receives from a licensing deal. Every contract specifies these shares, and they must always add up to 100%.

Here's an example:

| Party | Role | Share |
|-------|------|-------|
| Alex (you) | Composer / lyricist | 50% |
| Jordan | Co-writer | 25% |
| River Music Publishing | Publisher | 25% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

In this example, if a TV network pays $10,000 to license the track, you would receive $5,000, your co-writer would receive $2,500, and the publisher would receive $2,500.

  ProtoForge automatically validates that all rights splits total exactly 100%. A contract cannot be generated or sent for signature if the splits don't add up. This protects everyone involved.

## What "writer share" and "publisher share" mean

In music publishing, revenue is often divided into two halves:

- **Writer's share** — the portion that belongs to the songwriter(s). This is typically collected by your Performing Rights Organization (PRO), such as ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.
- **Publisher's share** — the portion that belongs to the publisher who administers and promotes the work. If you self-publish, you may control both shares.

When your contract says "50% writer share," it means you receive 50% of the total revenue generated by the license.

## Territories

A territory defines the geographic regions where the licensee can use your music. Common territory terms you'll see:

- **Worldwide** — the license applies everywhere, with no geographic restrictions
- **North America** — United States and Canada
- **European Union** — EU member states
- **Specific countries** — the contract may list individual countries by name

<Callout type="warning">
  Pay attention to the territory in your contract. A worldwide license gives the licensee broader usage rights than a license limited to a single country. This can affect the value of the deal and your ability to license the same music elsewhere.

## Duration

Duration specifies how long the license lasts. Common terms include:

- **Perpetual** — the license never expires (sometimes called "in perpetuity")
- **Fixed term** — the license lasts for a specific period (e.g., 2 years, 5 years)
- **Project-based** — the license lasts for the life of a specific production (e.g., a particular film or TV series)

When a fixed-term license expires, the licensee can no longer use your music unless they renew the agreement.

## Exclusivity

Exclusivity determines whether the licensee is the only party who can use your music under the agreed terms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Exclusive License" icon="lock">
    Only the licensee can use your music in the specified way, territory, and duration. You cannot license the same rights to another party during the contract period.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Non-Exclusive License" icon="lock-open">
    The licensee can use your music, but you're free to license the same music to other parties as well. This is more flexible for you as the composer.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Exclusive licenses typically command higher fees because the licensee is paying for sole access.

## Most Favoured Nation (MFN)

You may see an MFN clause in your contract. This is a protection mechanism that ensures equal treatment between parties. If one songwriter on a track receives better terms — a higher fee, a larger split — an MFN clause guarantees that you receive the same improved terms automatically.

<Callout type="tip">
  MFN clauses are there to protect you. If you see one in your contract, it means no other party on the same deal can receive more favorable terms than you without those terms being extended to you as well.
