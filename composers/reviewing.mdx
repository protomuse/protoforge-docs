Before you sign anything, it's important to read and understand every part of your contract. This guide walks through each section you'll encounter and explains what to look for.

<Callout type="tip">
  Take your time — there's no rush to sign. Your contract link won't expire for 7 days, and you can come back to it as many times as you need before signing.

## Contract sections explained

Every ProtoForge contract is assembled from standardized, pre-approved clauses organized into clear categories. Here's what each section covers and what to pay attention to.

### Grant of Rights

This is the core of the contract. It defines exactly what you're allowing the other party to do with your music.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Grant of Rights">
  - **What type of rights are being granted?** Sync rights (composition), master rights (recording), or both.
  - **Is the grant exclusive or non-exclusive?** Exclusive means only this licensee can use your music under these terms. Non-exclusive means you can license it to others too.
  - **What specific uses are permitted?** Film, TV, advertising, streaming, social media, gaming — the contract should list which media formats are covered.
  - **Are there sub-licensing rights?** Can the licensee allow others to use your music, or only use it themselves?
</Accordion>

<Callout type="warning">
  This section has the biggest impact on how your music can be used. Read it carefully and make sure you're comfortable with the scope of rights being granted.
</Callout>

### Financial Terms

This section explains how you get paid — the amounts, the timing, and the method.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Financial Terms">
  - **Upfront fee** — a one-time payment made when the contract is signed (sometimes called a "sync fee")
  - **Royalties** — ongoing payments based on how the music is used (e.g., per broadcast, per stream)
  - **Revenue split** — your percentage share of licensing revenue. ProtoForge validates that all splits total exactly 100%.
  - **Payment schedule** — when payments are made (e.g., within 30 days, quarterly)
  - **Payment method** — how you'll receive payment (wire transfer, check, etc.)
</Accordion>

### Usage Restrictions

These clauses define boundaries around how your music can be used. They protect you by limiting the licensee to specific, agreed-upon uses.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Usage Restrictions">
  - **Prohibited uses** — specific contexts where your music cannot be used (e.g., political campaigns, adult content, tobacco advertising)
  - **Format restrictions** — limitations on media formats (e.g., broadcast TV only, not streaming)
  - **Modification restrictions** — whether the licensee can edit, remix, or alter your music
  - **Attribution requirements** — whether your name must be credited when the music is used
</Accordion>

<Callout type="info">
  Usage restrictions work in your favor. They ensure your music is only used in contexts you've agreed to. If a specific restriction is important to you and isn't included, discuss it with the publisher before signing.
</Callout>

### Territory

Territory specifies the geographic regions where the license applies.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Territory">
  - **Worldwide vs. regional** — a worldwide license covers all countries. A regional license is limited to specific areas.
  - **Named countries or regions** — the contract may list specific countries (e.g., "United States and Canada") or broader regions (e.g., "European Union").
  - **Digital distribution** — for online content, consider whether territory restrictions are practical. A YouTube video licensed for "North America only" may still be viewable globally.
</Accordion>

### Duration

Duration tells you how long the agreement lasts.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Duration">
  - **Fixed term** — the license runs for a specific period (e.g., 3 years from the date of signing). After that, rights revert to you unless renewed.
  - **Perpetual** — the license has no end date. This is common for film and TV placements where the production will exist indefinitely.
  - **Renewal terms** — does the contract automatically renew? If so, under what conditions, and can you opt out?
</Accordion>

### Termination

These clauses explain when and how the contract can end before its natural expiration.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Termination">
  - **Termination for cause** — either party can end the contract if the other party violates its terms (e.g., non-payment, unauthorized use)
  - **Termination for convenience** — either party can end the contract with advance notice, even without a specific reason
  - **Notice period** — how much advance notice is required to terminate (e.g., 30 days, 90 days)
  - **Post-termination rights** — what happens to existing uses of your music after the contract ends. Can the licensee continue using it in productions already released?
</Accordion>

### Representations and Warranties

This section contains promises that each party makes. As a composer, you'll typically be confirming that:

<Accordion title="Common representations">
  - You are the rightful owner (or authorized representative) of the music
  - The music is original and doesn't infringe on anyone else's rights
  - You have the authority to enter into this agreement
  - There are no other agreements that conflict with this one
</Accordion>

### Governing Law and Disputes

This section specifies which jurisdiction's laws apply to the contract and how disagreements will be resolved.

<Accordion title="What to look for in Governing Law">
  - **Governing law** — which country or state's laws apply (e.g., "governed by the laws of England and Wales")
  - **Dispute resolution** — whether disputes go to court, mediation, or arbitration
  - **Venue** — where any legal proceedings would take place
</Accordion>
