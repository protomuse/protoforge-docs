This glossary covers the terms you're most likely to encounter when reviewing a ProtoForge contract. Everything is explained in plain English — no legal or technical background required.

### Audit Trail

A chronological record of every action taken on a contract — when it was created, sent, opened, and signed by each party. ProtoForge's audit trail is tamper-proof, meaning it uses cryptographic verification to ensure no one can alter the record after the fact.

### Cue Sheet

A document that lists every piece of music used in a production (such as a film, TV episode, or advertisement), along with details like the composer's name, publisher, duration of use, and how the music was used (background, featured, theme, etc.). Cue sheets are essential for ensuring composers receive their performance royalties.

### DocuSeal

The electronic signature platform used by ProtoForge. When you receive a contract to sign, DocuSeal handles the secure signing process in your browser. You don't need a DocuSeal account to sign.

### Duration

How long a license agreement lasts. A contract may specify a fixed term (e.g., 3 years), a perpetual term (no end date), or a project-based term (lasting as long as the specific production exists).

### Exclusive License

A license where only one party (the licensee) is permitted to use the music under the agreed terms. During an exclusive license period, you cannot grant the same rights to anyone else. Exclusive licenses typically command higher fees than non-exclusive ones.

### Fully Executed

A contract becomes "fully executed" when all required parties have signed. Until every signer has completed their signature, the contract is not yet legally in effect.

### Governing Law

The legal jurisdiction whose laws apply to a contract. For example, a contract might state it is "governed by the laws of the State of California" or "governed by the laws of England and Wales." This determines which courts and legal standards apply if a dispute arises.

### Grant of Rights

The section of a contract that defines exactly what rights you are granting to the other party. This includes the type of rights (sync, master, or both), the scope of permitted uses, and whether the grant is exclusive or non-exclusive.

### ISRC (International Standard Recording Code)

A unique 12-character identifier assigned to a specific sound recording. Every distinct recording — including different mixes, edits, or remasters — gets its own ISRC. Think of it as a serial number for a recording. Example format: US-ABC-23-12345.

### ISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)

A unique identifier for a musical composition (the underlying work, not a specific recording of it). While an ISRC identifies a recording, an ISWC identifies the song itself regardless of who performs or records it. Example format: T-012.345.678-9.

### Master Rights

The rights associated with a specific sound recording. If someone wants to use your actual recording (as opposed to having someone else re-record the composition), they need master rights. The owner of master rights is typically the person or entity that paid for the recording session.

### MFN (Most Favoured Nation)

A contract clause that guarantees equal treatment between parties. If one songwriter on a track receives better terms (higher fee, larger split), an MFN clause ensures all other parties automatically receive the same improved terms. It's a fairness protection.

### Non-Exclusive License

A license where multiple parties can be granted the same rights to use the music. You remain free to license the same work to others. Non-exclusive licenses offer more flexibility but may command lower fees than exclusive ones.

### Perpetual

A license term meaning "forever" — the agreement has no end date. This is common in film and TV placements where the production will continue to exist and be distributed indefinitely.

### PRO (Performing Rights Organization)

An organization that collects performance royalties on behalf of songwriters and publishers. When your music is played on TV, radio, in a venue, or streamed online, your PRO collects the royalties owed to you. Major PROs include:

- **ASCAP** (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers)
- **BMI** (Broadcast Music, Inc.)
- **SESAC** (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers)
- **PRS for Music** (UK)
- **GEMA** (Germany)
- **SACEM** (France)

### Publisher

A company or individual that manages and administers musical works on behalf of songwriters. Publishers handle licensing, royalty collection, and promotion. In a ProtoForge contract, the publisher is typically the party creating and sending the contract.

### Rights Split

The percentage breakdown of how revenue from a license is divided among the parties involved. For example, a 50/25/25 split means the first party receives 50% of the revenue, and the other two parties each receive 25%. ProtoForge requires that all splits total exactly 100%.

### Sync License

A legal agreement granting permission to use a musical composition in synchronization with visual content — film, TV, advertising, video games, online video, and other audiovisual media. "Sync" is short for "synchronization."

### Sync Rights

The rights to synchronize a musical composition with visual content. These rights relate to the underlying composition (melody, lyrics, arrangement), not the specific recording. Sync rights are separate from master rights.

### Territory

The geographic area where a license applies. A contract might specify "worldwide" (all countries), a region (e.g., "European Union"), or specific countries (e.g., "United States, Canada, and United Kingdom"). The licensee can only use your music within the specified territory.

### Token

In ProtoForge, a token is a placeholder in a contract template that gets filled with specific data when the contract is generated. For example, a token like `{{composer_name}}` is replaced with your actual name, and `{{sync_fee}}` is replaced with the agreed fee amount. You'll see the final, filled-in values in your contract — not the tokens themselves.

### Termination

The conditions under which a contract can end before its natural expiration. Common types include termination for cause (one party violated the terms), termination for convenience (either party wants to end the agreement with advance notice), and termination upon specific events.

### Writer's Share

The portion of royalty revenue that belongs to the songwriter(s). In traditional music publishing, revenue is split into a writer's share and a publisher's share. Your writer's share is typically collected and paid to you by your PRO.
