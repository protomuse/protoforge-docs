description: "What happens after you sign a ProtoForge contract — PDF copies, audit trail, and next steps"
---

You've signed your contract — here's what happens next and what you can expect going forward.

## What happens immediately

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your signature is recorded">
    The moment you submit your signature, it's recorded in ProtoForge's audit trail with a timestamp and cryptographic hash. This creates a tamper-proof record that your signature was applied at that exact moment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The publisher is notified">
    The publisher (or rights manager) who sent you the contract receives an automatic notification that you've signed. They can see the status update in their ProtoForge dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Other signers are prompted (if applicable)">
    If the contract requires signatures from additional parties — co-writers, other rights holders, or the publisher themselves — those parties are notified that it's their turn to sign.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When the contract is fully executed

A contract is "fully executed" when all required parties have signed. Once that happens:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="You receive a PDF copy" icon="file-pdf">
    A complete PDF of the fully signed contract is sent to your email. This is your official copy for your records.
  </Card>
  <Card title="All parties are notified" icon="bell">
    Everyone who signed the contract receives confirmation that it's now fully executed and legally in effect.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="tip">
  Save your PDF copy somewhere safe — a dedicated folder on your computer, a cloud storage service, or wherever you keep important documents. While ProtoForge maintains a record, having your own copy is always good practice.

## The audit trail

Every ProtoForge contract has a complete audit trail — a chronological record of every action taken, from the moment the contract was created to the final signature. This includes:

- When the contract was created and by whom
- When it was sent to you
- When you opened it
- When you signed it
- When each other party signed
- When the contract became fully executed

This audit trail uses hash-chain verification, which means each entry is cryptographically linked to the previous one. If anyone tried to alter the record, the chain would break and the tampering would be immediately detectable. This protects you and all other parties.

## If other parties haven't signed yet

If your contract requires multiple signatures and you've signed but others haven't yet, you're in a waiting period. Here's what to know:

- **You'll be notified** when the contract is fully executed. There's nothing you need to do in the meantime.
- **Your signature stands.** You don't need to sign again, even if it takes time for other parties to complete their signatures.
- **The contract isn't in effect yet.** Until all required parties have signed, the agreement isn't legally binding. It only becomes effective once fully executed.

<Callout type="info">
  If you're waiting for other parties to sign and it's been a while, you can reach out to the publisher who sent the contract. They can see the signing status for all parties in their ProtoForge dashboard and can send reminders.

## Accessing your signed contracts

If you need to access your signed contract after the fact:

1. **Check your email** — search for emails from ProtoForge or DocuSeal. The PDF of your fully signed contract was sent to the email address associated with your signature.
2. **Contact the publisher** — the publisher who sent you the contract can provide another copy from their ProtoForge dashboard at any time. The contract and all its associated records are stored securely.

## Questions or concerns?

<Accordion title="What if I signed by mistake or want to withdraw?">
  Once a contract is signed, the signature is legally binding. If you have concerns about a contract you've already signed, consult with a qualified legal professional for advice specific to your situation. ProtoForge cannot modify or void a signed contract on your behalf.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I never received my PDF copy?">
  Check your spam or junk mail folder first. If you still can't find it, contact the publisher who sent you the contract. They can access the signed document from their ProtoForge dashboard and send you a copy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the contract terms aren't being honored?">
  Contract enforcement is between the signing parties. If you believe the other party isn't fulfilling their obligations under the contract, refer to the dispute resolution clause in your agreement. The ProtoForge audit trail can serve as evidence of the agreed-upon terms if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who do I contact for support?">
  For questions about the ProtoForge platform or the signing process, contact the publisher who sent you the contract — they're your primary point of contact. For questions about specific contract terms, consult with your own legal or professional advisor.
