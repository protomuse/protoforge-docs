When you're ready to sign your contract, the process is straightforward. ProtoForge uses DocuSeal, a secure electronic signature platform, to handle the signing process. Here's exactly what to expect.

## Signing step by step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the email from ProtoForge">
    You'll receive an email with the subject line indicating a contract is ready for your review. The email contains a secure link to your contract. Click the link to open it in your web browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the contract">
    The contract opens in your browser, showing all the terms, clauses, and details. Scroll through each page to read the full agreement. If you haven't already, use the [reviewing guide](/composers/reviewing) to understand each section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in any required fields">
    Some contracts may ask you to fill in specific information — your full legal name, date, address, or other details. These fields will be clearly highlighted so you know exactly what's needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your electronic signature">
    When you reach the signature section, click on the signature field. You can sign by:
    - **Typing your name** — the system generates a signature from your typed name
    - **Drawing your signature** — use your mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen to draw your signature
    - **Uploading an image** — upload a saved image of your signature
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and submit">
    After adding your signature, review everything one final time. When you're satisfied, click the submit button to complete the signing process. Your signature is now legally recorded.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive your confirmation">
    You'll see an on-screen confirmation that your signature has been submitted. A PDF copy of the signed contract will be sent to your email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently asked questions

<Accordion title="Are electronic signatures legally binding?">
  Yes. Electronic signatures are legally recognized in most jurisdictions worldwide, including under the U.S. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN), the EU Electronic Identification and Authentication Services (eIDAS) regulation, and the UK Electronic Communications Act. Your DocuSeal signature carries the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I'm not ready to sign yet?">
  No problem. You don't have to sign immediately. Your contract link remains active for 7 days. You can close the browser and come back to it later using the same link from your email. Your progress won't be lost.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I sign on my phone or tablet?">
  Yes. The signing interface works on any modern web browser, whether you're on a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. If you're signing on a touchscreen device, you can draw your signature directly with your finger.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my link expires?">
  Contract links are valid for 7 days. If your link expires before you sign, contact the publisher who sent you the contract and ask them to resend it through ProtoForge. They can generate a new signing link for you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I make changes to the contract before signing?">
  The contract you receive has been assembled with agreed-upon terms. If you want to request changes, reach out to the publisher directly before signing. Do not sign a contract you're not comfortable with — once signed, the terms are binding.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to create an account?">
  No. You can review and sign contracts without creating a ProtoForge account. Everything happens through the secure link sent to your email.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if there are multiple signers?">
  Some contracts require signatures from multiple parties (e.g., co-writers, publishers, recording owners). You only need to sign your own portion. ProtoForge tracks which parties have signed and notifies everyone when the contract is fully executed.
