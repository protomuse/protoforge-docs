If you're reading this, someone has sent you a music licensing contract through ProtoForge. That's great news — it means your music is being considered for placement in film, TV, advertising, or other visual media. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

## What is sync licensing?

Sync licensing (short for "synchronization licensing") is the process of granting permission to use a piece of music alongside visual content — think a track playing during a movie scene, a TV commercial, a video game, or a YouTube video.

When someone wants to use your music this way, they need a legal agreement that spells out the terms: what they can use, where, for how long, and how you get paid. That agreement is your sync license contract.

## What is ProtoForge?

ProtoForge is a platform that makes sync licensing contracts faster and simpler for everyone involved. Instead of weeks of back-and-forth emails and paper documents, ProtoForge assembles contracts from pre-approved legal language, sends them to you electronically, and lets you review and sign from your browser.

Every contract is built from a library of 146 pre-approved legal clauses that have been reviewed by legal professionals. Nothing is improvised or auto-generated — the language in your contract comes from a vetted, standardized library.

## What to expect

Here's what the process looks like from your side:

    Click the link to open your contract. You'll see all the terms laid out clearly — what rights are being licensed, your share of the revenue, where and how long your music can be used, and any restrictions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You sign electronically">
    When you're ready, you sign the contract electronically right in your browser. It's legally binding and fully secure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You get a copy">
    After everyone has signed, you receive a PDF copy of the fully executed contract for your records.

## Your contract is secure

Every contract in ProtoForge is tracked with a tamper-proof audit trail. This means there's a verifiable record of when the contract was created, when it was sent to you, when you opened it, and when you signed. No one can alter the contract after the fact without it being detected.
